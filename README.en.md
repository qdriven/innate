# Innate

> Your True Self Through Creations

## About

This repository is a small place for honest practice and gentle reflection.

A resume can be useful, but it is also a necessary compression of a living person. What feels more true, to me, is the breathing evidence: what I build, what I try, what I notice, and what I learn along the way.

“Innate” is a reminder to return to the inside, then let the inside show up through creation.

## Philosophy

### From Abstraction to Reality

- A resume is not a lie. It is a necessary compression: a map, not the territory.
- Creations and living thoughts are closer to the territory. They carry texture, time, mistakes, and growth: the breathing evidence of a person.

### Unity of Knowledge and Action

To me, unity is not a slogan. It is a daily practice of embodiment: let what I understand show up in what I do, even in small, imperfect steps.

A simple loop that helps:

- Notice desire: vanity, fear, control, rushing.
- Shift position: try another angle, another person, another time.
- Keep the heart steady, then respond to what is actually happening.
- Do one small action, then reflect and adjust.

## Content

- Living ideas: raw thoughts, evolving concepts, seeds of future projects.
- Authentic practice: projects driven by curiosity rather than external expectations.
- Reflections: what changed, what stayed, what I want to try next.

## Intent

To cultivate a digital identity rooted in substance rather than form. To let the work speak, and let the self grow through the act of creation.
