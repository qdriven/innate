# README

What I want to do:
1. extract all the structured data from the json file, and store the key into a csv file
2. every key has both english and chinese translation


use python to do this, please help to do it, the can't translate directly,could call LLM API directly to translate, or use local translate application to translate.

But before write code, translate the json file into a csv file, and store the key and translation into a csv file first.
